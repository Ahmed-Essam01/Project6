# ðŸ’° Loan Approval Prediction

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details like income, loan amount, employment status, and credit history.  
It focuses on data preprocessing and evaluating model performance on imbalanced data.

## ðŸ§  Project Steps
- Load and preprocess the Loan Approval dataset (Kaggle)
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables
- Train a classification model (Logistic Regression or Random Forest)
- Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Explore class imbalance and apply resampling techniques if needed
